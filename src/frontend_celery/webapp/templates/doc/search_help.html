    <strong>Explanation of the columns:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>CHR: chromosome</li>
        <li>POS: GRCH38, left-aligned position</li>
        <li>REF: reference base(s)</li>
        <li>ALT: alternative base(s)</li>
        <li>HGVS c.: the HGVS c. string for this variant. The reference transcript is the mane select transcript for the gene of this variants' gene.</li>
        <li>HGVS p.: the HGVS p. HGVS string for this variant. The reference transcript is the mane select transcript for the gene of this variants' gene.</li>
        <li>GENE: the gene which has the variant. Sometimes there are multiple genes, because the variant has consequences in all of them.</li>
        <li>Your classification: the classification of the user which is currently logged in.</li>
        <li>Consensus classificaiton: the most recent consensus class as specified by the VUS-task-force.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="bst">
    <strong>You can filter the table of variants by:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>A gene name or unique alias or HGVS-ID (e. g. BARD1)</li>
        <li>A chromosomal range of the form: chr:start-end. Start and end values are inclusive. (e. g. chr2:214767531-214780740)</li>
        <li>A HGVS c. string. <br>
            This search option is most useful when you know the reference transcript. In this case please specify the search string like this: Transcript:c.PositionReference>Alternative (e. g. ENST00000260947:c.1972C>T). <br>
            If you do not know the transcript you can also specify the gene-symbol (or alias or HGVS-ID) instead of the transcript (e. g. BARD1:c.1972C>T)<br>
            In case you do neither know the transcript nor the gene it is also possible to omit the reference sequence. But, be careful with this type of search as it will provide you with ALL possible nucleotide changes that COULD be the one you were looking for. Thus, you should inspect the results carefully before continueing. (e. g. c.1972C>T)<br>
            WARNING: if you do not specify the reference transcript the algorithm will choose the ensembl mane select transcript as reference. If there is no mane select transcript it will omit this HGVS.
        </li>
        <li>A consensus classification</li>
        <li>Your classification</li>
    </ul>
    <div >If multiple constraints are selected they are joined with 'AND'. This means that if you choose to search for BARD1 in the genes and select consensus classification 1 you will get all variants from BARD1 which are classified with 1.</div>
    <div class="sst">You can separate multiple genes, HGVS or chromosomal ranges in their respective fields either with semicolons (';'), commas (','), tabulators or newlines. It is also possible to have a combination of them.</div>

    <strong>Meaning of the classes:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1: Benign</li>
        <li>2: Likely benign</li>
        <li>3: Uncertain significance</li>
        <li>4: Likely pathogenic</li>
        <li>5: Pathogenic</li>
        <li>none ("-"): Unclassified</li>
