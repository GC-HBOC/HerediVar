        Integrating bioinformatics and functional genomics in the clinical classification of genetic variation: Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer as a paradigm (HerediVar)

    <h4>Hypothesis & Goal</h4>
    <div>
        The major challenge posed by next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques in genomic medicine is the classification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). 
        To realize a timely and cost-effective classification of VUS, an interactive integrated variant database (HerediVar) will be developed for high-throughput 
        classification of genetic variants by the expert panel of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC) along with experimental analyses. 
        Thus, HerediVar closes the gap between genetic data analyses and clinical interpretation. <br>
        To achive this, variants are imported and annotated from the established central family database (HerediCaRe). Among others, the annotation comprises multiple in 
        silico prediction tools, precalculated scores as well as literature and consequence annotations. This evidence allows for a sophisticated pathogenicity classification 
        based on a classification scheme like the well-known ACMG guidelines.
