<h1> {% block title %} Deleted Variant {% endblock %} </h1>

<div>
    This variant was deleted from HerediVar. <br>
    Most likely you see this page, because you tried to reannotate a variant which was previously removed from HerediCare. <br>
    This caused it to be deleted from HerediVar as well.
